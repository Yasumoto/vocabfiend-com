    <h1>VocabFiend</h1>
    <h2>Create amazing stories with your friends!</h2>
    <p>The core of VocabFiend is telling stories with your friends. With a simple, clean interface, you are empowered to let your imagination run wild while using new words to direct the story!</p>
    <p>If you have a friend who is studying for an upcoming test, you can help them study by telling stories which use difficult and new words!</p>

    <h2>Improve your vocabulary for the GRE!</h2>
    <p>By removing the typical time limits, points values, and other judgements from typical games, we have found that VocabFiend's formula reduces stress and lets students focus on the words they want to improve upon. The current core list is aimed at the GRE standardized test.</p>
    <h2>How to Play</h2>
    <p>When you create a story, you are taken to a screen with three words. Use those to seed your idea, and make sure you use those words in your story! Once you're ready, submit it to your friend using GameKit.</p>
    <p>Your friend will get a notification and be able to read your story, then continue writing with three new words to use.</p>
    <p>See how long your story can grow!</p>
